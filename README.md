# Zainatul Izzah - Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Izzah! I hold a **PhD in Nanomaterial Science**, and I'm currently transitioning into the world of **Data Science**. With a strong analytical background rooted in scientific research, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the power of data to drive innovation and discovery.

Throughout my academic journey, I worked with complex datasets and rigorous statistical methods — all of which sparked my passion for data-driven problem-solving. Now, I’m channeling that energy into a career as an entry-level **Data Analyst**.

🔬 From lab work to data work, I’ve:
- Handled messy, multi-dimensional datasets
- Drawn insights from experimental data
- Built models to interpret complex phenomena
- Gained experience in statistical analysis, coding, and data visualization

Outside the academic world, I’m always:
- Exploring new data tools and techniques
- Working on personal projects and dashboards
- Expanding my skills in SQL, Power BI, Python, and beyond

Whether collaborating with a team or diving into solo analysis, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for solving real-world problems with data.
